# corporatize
Makes limitless quantities of form letters. Specifically geared towards making mass quantities of extremely ineffective Jehovah's Witness letters about the Bible while appearing to be very productive. The base templates are made to look like form letters, with unique form IDs, double-sided envelope printing with a logo on the back, and more! It can also convert databases from ReferenceUSA (available through the Kalamazoo Public Library among others) to lists of names and addresses, while targeting only the occupant that least matches the target demographic of JWs (older females). Currently envelope printing is not compatible with all printers, so please keep that in mind, although the template format is versatile so you should be able to modify it for your own printer if necessary.

### Why?
If you have to write these letters, but really hope nobody converts due to the extreme beliefs of the religion, use this! You'll be guaranteed to get zero replies, while appearing to be very productive.

## NOTE:
Corporatize is currently only compatible with Linux. It makes use of lpr to print because I was too lazy to figure anything else out.
